This project is a simplified Python implementation and visualization of multi-agent collective construction inspired by:

Multi-agent Collective Construction using 3D Decomposition
Hansen et al., 2023
https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00985

The system takes a 3D voxel structure, decomposes it into independent substructures, computes dependency constraints, determines a parallelizable construction schedule, and  animates the full construction process.
